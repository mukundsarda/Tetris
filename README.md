# Tetris
This project aims to deploy and automate two versions of a Dockerized Tetris game simultaneously on Kubernetes clusters using ArgoCD for continuous deployment, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Jenkins for continuous integration, and Kubernetes for container orchestration. Additionally, the project aims to implement auto-scaling mechanisms to manage fluctuating demand efficiently.
The deployment pipeline began with the setup of DigitalOcean Droplets, where infrastructure provisioning and management were streamlined using Terraform. Jenkins played a pivotal role in continuous integration and delivery, orchestrating automated build processes and ensuring code quality through integration with SonarQube. ArgoCD brought declarative and GitOps-based deployment management, allowing for efficient synchronization of application changes.
Both Tetris versions were deployed with precision, leveraging the power of automation to handle infrastructure provisioning, code analysis, and Kubernetes deployment updates seamlessly. Load testing using Locust ensured the scalability and performance of the applications, providing insights into their ability to handle concurrent user requests.
